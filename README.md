# Angular-Ecom

# E-commerce MEAN Stack App

The E-commerce MEAN App combines the power of MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, and Node.js with the design and user interactions with the products.


# In development, all Angular components, modules, and services are located in the "angular/src" directory. 
# The app has three main components: Home, Products, and User. The Home component contains the home page serving as the landing page for the app. 
# The Products component uses the data service to retrieve all products and programmatically display them as Material Design cards. 
# Finally, the User component can interact with these products, get/add/edit/delete any product after registering or logging in.
